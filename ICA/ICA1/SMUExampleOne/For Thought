Zeqi Guo, Kuang Yan

Is this new implementation of the model more efficient? Why or Why not? 
  No. Because it will pre-load all of the pictures, and this is a waste of memory.

Is this implementation of the model scalable? Why or Why not? 
  Yes, because all of the image (both image view and collection view) is loaded by image name, so as long as we add images into image.assets 
  file and we can use the name to find the image.

If there were 1000 images in the image.assets file, what would you change in the implementationof the model? 
  In such condition, I prefer not pre-load all of images, because 1000 images will waste a lot of time and memory. So, based on our model,
  which can find picture by its name, we can eaisly pre-load all of names of pictures, and then find picture with its name.
